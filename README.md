# Autonomous-Robotic-System---Mobile-robot
Autonomous robotic system simulating exploration, localization, mapping, and navigation using differential drive, Kalman Filter, EKF-SLAM, and a neural controller evolved via Natural Evolution Strategies (NES). Developed in Python (Pygame, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib) for the Autonomous Robotic Systems course.
